                    <h1 style="font-size:x-large">We struggled, so now you don’t have to.</h1>
					<hr>

                    <p>I wanted to change the world with a snap of my fingers. I know I know, Riya, that’s not how the world works. You cannot change anything by just snapping your fingers. But hey in my defence I was still a kid then (as I am now, btw).</p>
					<hr>
					<p>And then I became a college going zombie. Wake up at 7, go to a German class, wander around for an hour or if there was a class then, bunk it, start attending classes, become exhausted. If I attended a class, well, I got bored. If I didn’t, I missed the lecture notes. And since I don’t have any close friends in my batch, no one was there to give me their notes. I tried searching for notes online, but they weren’t the quality I wanted them to be and I had no idea who the hell had made them. I thought little of it at the time.</p>
					<hr>
					<p>I realised how big a problem this was when lockdown started and I was literally locked out of my notes (they were still kept in some dusty corner in the hostel room). I desperately wished someone would send me their notes, but of course since I did not have a close friend, I had no courage to ask anyone else either. I wanted notes, and all I got online was printed notes copied from xyz book by some xyz person. I didn’t want that. I wanted notes written by a student and something that I could verify with my own eyes.</p>
					<hr>
					<p>And that is the story of how NoteBuzz was born. I gathered up a few friends interested in this idea and made NoteBuzz a reality. All my friends are college students, so we all understand you all. NoteBuzz is what I call ‘For students by students’. Your own personal notes library.</p>
